# HTML Reader

This is a simple Java tool which reads people's first and last names from HTML tables in the following format:

```html
<table>
<tr>...<th>First Name</th><th>Last Name</th>...</tr>
<tr>...<td>Kostadin</td><td>Stoilov</td>...</tr>
```
The tool produces output in either plain (FirstName LastName) or RDF.(n-triples, turtle, rdfxml) format.

There are two files with sample data in this repository with which the tool is tested, but theoretically it should work with any HTML table in the above format.
